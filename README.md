Marvel - Ultimate War is a two-player battle game built using Java on a Model-View-Controller pattern, utilizing concepts of OOP, and JavaFx for the GUI. The game was thoroughly tested using JUnit Testing after every major milestone. 

The game starts by each of the players forming their team of Marvel heroes, antiheroes, and villains. The players then take turns back-and-forth attempting to defeat the opponent's team, and the first player to eliminate the entire opposing team wins the game.
